        <p> Hi, My name is Dylan. Im currently a Salesman and have been coding for a good few years. 
            I've had a life long passion for problem solving which has led me to have both programming and rock climbing as my two major hobbies.
            I graduated High School in 2020 and have been juggling university and work ever since, finding myself doing a coding bootcamp as, 
            even though i have been coding for just about 6 years, I've never really built a proper portfolio. <span class="content-split"></span> I'm enjoying learning new skills
            that come with actually developing something for myself and where I hope to end up with it. Have a look at my previous work. its going to 
            have a mixture of java, javascript, c, and some python hopefully in the near future.
        </p>
